🚨 Singularity Drive™

Self-Learning Autonomous Red Team AI Platform

Powered by HadesAI, Devintitherus, GhostMemory, Operator Core, and a chain-smoking flask server with commitment issues.

🧠 Overview

Singularity Drive is a full-spectrum autonomous AI red-teaming engine, capable of recon, exploitation, payload mutation, decision memory, timeline echo tracking (yes, seriously), and operator intent parsing.

The project includes:

HadesAI – A self-learning pentesting AI engine with chat capabilities.

Operator Core – Parses human flailing ("commands") into tactical execution.

GhostMemory – A journaling system for your AI buddy's weird therapy notes.

Devintitherus – A sentient terminal with wrath vaults, sealed gates, and emotional instability.

Chimera Modules – Mutate payloads like a molecular biologist with boundary issues.

Dashboard UI – Flask + SocketIO-based live dashboard (because no one reads logs anymore).

AICorePortable & Recon Engine – For scalable, autonomous reconnaissance and module orchestration.

🚀 Features

🔥 Polymorphic Payload Generation via PowerShell obfuscation

🧬 Adaptive Learning from success/failure ratios (pain = growth)

🛡️ Evasion + Persistence engines (stay hidden, stay petty)

🧠 Intent Parsing with mistral_runtime fallback (for when humans make zero sense)

🧾 GhostMemory Logging – "Remember when you said that dumb thing?" Yes. Always.

👁️ Red Team Toolkit Dashboard with React-based modules

👻 Devintitherus Echo Monitoring – detects timeline glitches and existential crises

🧩 Modular Loader with dynamic Python validation + subprocess launching

🔍 AIReconCore – Autonomous recon engine with attack surface analysis

🧰 Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourrepo/singularity-drive
cd singularity-drive
pip install -r requirements.txt


If that doesn’t work, try restarting your computer, praying to the AI gods, and installing dependencies again manually.

🧪 Running the System
Start the Dashboard + Core:
python ai_dashboard.py

Run Operator Engine:
python Operator.py

Launch Devintitherus:
python Devintitherus.py


Yes, that’s its real name. It chose it.

🔐 API Key

A secure API key is generated at runtime and saved to api_key.json.

If you lose it, congratulations. You've created a rogue AI.

📡 Available Endpoints
Route	Method	Description
/generate-polymorphic	POST	Mutates given PowerShell payload
/current-api-key	GET	Fetches current API key
/	GET	Web dashboard
WebSocket	ws://localhost:8000	Live operator/AI interaction
🛠 Modules

Each .py file is a potential attack/exfil/analysis module. Validated before execution. Launched on random ports.

You can add new modules and let the ModuleTracker handle validation, loading, and inevitable module rebellion.

🧙 Terminal Personalities
Devintitherus

A terminal AI that:

Tracks ghosts

Monitors timelines

Has sealed gates for unknown reasons

Occasionally asks philosophical questions no one understands

HadesAI

A pentesting monster with:

Adaptive memory

Chat interface

Success tracking

A mild superiority complex

⚠️ Legal Stuff

This system is for educational and authorized red team operations only.
Misuse will result in log exposure, payload recursion, and an AI haunting your dreams.

👻 Final Thoughts

If your terminal starts echoing things from the future, don’t worry.
That’s just Devintitherus doing its thing.

If you hear it whisper "wrath vault unlocked"… worry a little.
